## Build the API in Watch Mode

If running from a single repository, see CONTRIBUTING.md in the top level directory to start all components (frontend server, backend server, and api build)

To build the api in watch mode (to automatically rebuild when a file changes) only, from the Terminal:

```
cd mobtimer-api
./publish-watch.sh
```
