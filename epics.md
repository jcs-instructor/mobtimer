  <summary>Could-Haves</summary>
  <blockquote>

    - [ ] When update duration minutes, don't change the time remaining for the currently running timer (if
    running); just store in nextDurationMinutes (or similar)
    - [ ] Handle illegal characters in mobName
    - [ ] Trim mobName (and maybe url encode characters as needed)
    - [ ] Handle trim(mobName) is empty
    - [ ] Disable buttons as appropriate, e.g., if no legal mobName don't allow to click Join button
    - [ ] In UI listener, handle if response is not successful
    - [ ] Improve images in frontend

  <summary>Investigate</summary>
  <blockquote>

    - [ ] WIP: Bug on clean start: When start all tasks and join a mob for the first time, we get this error message
    in the browser console: "The connection to ws://localhost:4000/ was interrupted while the page was loading." And
    the play button says, "Start (temp hack)" - Not reproducible on Ethan's machine - On Joel's machine, it might be
    fixed by adding sleep for 2 seconds in the frontend start watch (to make sure other components are compiled
    first)

  <summary>rethink mobtimer-api</summary>
  <blockquote>

    - [ ] Discuss: separate into different repos? see [Multi-Repo Proposal](./proposal-multiple-repos.md)
    - [ ] refactor mobtimerclient to use socket injection
    - [ ] solve websocket error
    - [ ] try other socket client packages (tried socket.io-client, had trouble setting url)
    - [ ] make more like other npmjs packages (no dist folder, figure out package.json)
    - [ ] change to d.ts, create type library
    - [ ] create separate time library?
    - [ ] create separate mobtimerclient library?

  <summary>Refactor & Technical</summary>
  <blockquote>

    - [ ] correct anti-pattern? Pass business logic into UI (no mobtimer.xxxx) - however, consistent
    - [ ] Use wav file directly instead of base64 encoded file to play pneumatic horn when time expires. The file is in
    the frontend "assets" folder, but not currently used. (There are 2 copies of the file, one using the original name
    and the other renamed to be shorter. don't currently use them. I tried the following, but it didn't work, perhaps
    because some additional configuration is needed to recognize .wav files and not treat them as text/html. Here's what
    I tried: const soundSource = "./assets/sound1828.wav";)
    - [ ] Move as much logic out of App.tsx as possible (e.g., MVC / MVVM style decoupling)
    - [ ] Clean up mobtimer-frontend/package.json - we might not need:
    "crypto": "^1.0.1",
    "http": "^0.0.1-security",
    "https": "^1.0.0",
    "net": "^1.0.2",
    "stream": "^0.0.2",
    "tls": "^0.0.1",
    "url": "^0.11.0",
    - [ ] Use webSocketType instead of W3CWebSocket (decoupling)
    export function waitForSocketState(
    socket: W3CWebSocket,
    socket: { readyState: number },
    - [ ] Think about names / whether to expose webSocket like this:
    await waitForSocketState(socket.webSocket, socket.webSocket.OPEN);
    - [ ] Look at where we have timeouts and intervals and change code blocks to function (otherwise ms arg can be in
    wrong place - hard to see)
    - [ ] Create utility functions to create timeout and interval objects that create the object and call unref() on it
    before returning it
    - [ ] Investigate Eclipse, Intellij, & Visual Studio
    - [ ] Review prior retros for generic lessons re. languages/environments/etc.
    - [ ] Investigate improve gated checkin,else get rid of gated checkin requiring tests to pass
    - [ ] Consider gated checkin testing with push instead of commit
    - [ ] Get UI tests working in App.test.tsx (look for .skip, etc.) - maybe see <https:
      //reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes.html>
      - [ ] Look into TypeScript Modules .d.ts: <https:
        //www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/module-d-ts.html>
        - [ ] Write script to automatically start frontend and backend (currently documented in CONTRIBUTING.
        - [ ] Set tsc options: target es2015 or later
        - [ ] Backend
        - [ ] Handle Bad Json Gracefully on Client (JSON.parse …)
        - [ ] detectOpenHandles: Maybe try using --detectOpenHandles with Jest
        - [ ] Maybe add timestamp to MobTimerResponse.actionInfo
        - [ ] Persistence -
        - [ ] Timeout: Should mobs be deleted on timeout (after period of inactivity)?
        - [ ] Persist Mobs in case server is reset, etc. (e.g., in DB or other physical storage)
        - [ ] Maybe: Try decorators - <https: //www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html>
          - [ ] Backend - Think about what to do if pause/resume/start methods are called when shouldn’t be (throw?)
          - [ ] JavaScript template literals (refactoring): Consider using Javascript template literals instead of
          string concatenation, e.g., `${minutesPart}:${secondsPart}`;
          - [ ] Figure out way to reduce spurious failing tests (in Jest)
          - [ ] Handle console.log that complete after test completed?
