Improve Later

- [ ] Low priority. Ethan after hours:
  - [ ] 2nd crack on start scripts, think about class vs function
  - [ ] In tasks.json, reorder tasks by order of execution
- [ ] Ethan - between sessions:
  - [ ] Upgrade to new version of nodemon (current ver. 2.0.19, latest ver. 2.0.20)
- [ ] Delete old unused branches

Next

- [ ] Reset timer from UI (i.e,. Cancel)
  - [ ] WIP: See todo comments in test files - finished on 3/30/23 on "red" because need to implement resent in client and Action:
        - await client.reset();
        - expect(client.lastSuccessfulAction).toEqual(Action.Reset); 
- [ ] Investigate all error in Problems tab (e.g., tsconfig.json has a "bonjour" problem)
- [ ] Create VSCode extension (needed so we can use it ourselves)

- [ ] Get rid of # in URL - try BrowserRouter
  - [ ] Should we have something after main url and before room code?
- [ ] Review [Epics](./epics.md), and migrate into GitHub Issues?
- [ ] Cleanup
  - [ ] Maybe: Delete unused branches (?)
