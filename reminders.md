12/14/2022 - Ethan
12/7/2022 - Joel

**Warning**:

- Make sure to run tests manually frequently! (since we turned off gated checkins and are making ui changes)

**Practices to Focus On**:

- List accomplishments in retros
- Rotate who facilitates session startups & retros
- When entering commands from Terminal, write script first (so have a record of steps needed / makes environment changes repeatable)
- Snack for Ethan
- Always look at reminders & have 1 or 2 things to focus on (at least)

**Other Practices**:

- **Strict navigator style**
- **If confused as driver, ask questions rather than suggesting alternatives**
- **Consider working in parallel**
- **Full TDD w/explicit "Refactor" convo & impl. every time, including:**
  - No `any` types
  - Refactor redundant code
  - Encapsulate & information hide
  - Consistent level of abstraction
  - Consistent names & naming conventions (e.g., underscore for private fields, capitalization, etc.)
  - Avoid tech debt
  - If no state (i.e, only one instance) use function, not class
  - ... (add more as we go)
- **Retro at end of each 2-hour session (so can impl. immediately rather than wait a week)**
- **Phrases**:
  - "Got it" (ELMO) [Joel-not sure if this is working that well... 6/29/22]
  - "Hold on" (Navigator wants floor)
- **Remember to give credit to co-author**:

**Practices to Try**:

- **5/25/2022:** Each person gets approx. 1 hour to be the leader on what we work on

---

**Established Practices**:

- **Terminology**
  - VSCode Bar
  - Inline icons
  - Code Tab
  - Browser Tab
  - Left code pane, right code pane
- **Always verbalize intent**: Navigator verbalize your intent (why) before directing, when coding or exploring code
- **Avoid rabbit holes**: When exploring and mob timer elapses, reevaluate if going down a productive path
- **Scribe**: If desired, in retro, request that talker and scribe should be separate people
- **Commit frequently on feature branch**

**Cool Things to Use**:

- Outline feature in VS Code

**Appendix**:

- Consider other approaches to 100% pairing
- Consider time limits on tasks weâ€™re working on
- Use Zoom chat (or write on paper) when we have ideas we want to get out of our head but don't necessarily need to be discussed right then.
