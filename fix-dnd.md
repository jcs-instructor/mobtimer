- [] Move code that calls getItems to useEffect
- [] Modify getItems to take participants as an argument and iterate over participants, as we did previously
- [] You should now see the correct values first time in and when you reorder the original participants 
- [] Pass setParticipants from App to Room to ParticipantsDND
- [] Where setState is called, create a string array out of items array and call setParticipants

Next steps:
- [] Modify Participants section by copying ParticipantsDND or by editing to have drag and drop
- [] Remove ParticipantsDND
- [] Fix formatting
- [] Add Move Up and Move Down icon to each participant?
