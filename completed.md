## Completed (Done)

2023-07-??

- [x] **VSCode statusbar participants & roles** - make vscode statusbar look like the browser window title  
      - [x] Add participants & roles to VSCode statusbar
      - [x] **Rename debug** boolean in App.tsx to runningLocal (but leave vscode extension bool as is)
- [x] **frontendMobTimer expires twice bug** (if 8 min. duration, it expires at 5 min. & 8 min.) - maybe work on this after Generate exports watch is fixed

2023-06-28

- [x] **Rename autogenerated files**:
      - [x] exports.ts as exports-autogenerated.ts
      - [x] date.txt as date-autogenerated.txt
      
2023-06-27

- [x] **Exclude unneeded extenstion files** - We get this message:
      This extension consists of 7070 files, out of which 3001 are JavaScript files. For performance reasons, you should bundle your extension: https://aka.ms/vscode-bundle-extension . You should also exclude unnecessary files by adding them to your .vscodeignore: https://aka.ms/vscode-vscodeignore"
      
2023-06-05

- [x] Different background color when running on localhost (so can tell when on dev vs. deployed site)

2023-06-01

- [x] Make deployment UI look different from development UI

2023-05-17

- Button disabling: Trim input box value on submit and disable submit button when input box is invalid; do this for:
- [x] Join Mob button (enable if mobName.trim() !== '')
- [x] Add Participant button (enable if participantName.trim() !== '')
- [x] Update Duration button (enable if durationMinutes is equivalent to at least one second)
- [x] Rotate and Randomize Participants buttons (enable if there are at least 2 participants)

2023-05-15

- Edit roles (navigator, driver):
- [x] Implement generally
- [x] Unhardcode emojis for Navigator & Driver from browser tab title text

- Fix Bugs
- [x] When edit participants or roles, if you press Enter, it submits without prompting you to confirm
- [x] UI: Fix bug where not every countdown second appears (was reproducible if duration was set to 0.08888 min. or so)
- [x] Edit participants and roles input boxes - if you try to edit in the middle of the input box, it immediately updates and moves 
      the cursor to the end of the input box. (We might be able to live with this for now; but it needs to be fixed.)
      - [x] EditParticipants
      - [x] EditRoles
- [x] Edit Participants Syncing: Need to update the input box for editing participants whenever participants change; i.e., after: 
      add, rotate, randommize, update (i.e., trimmed values), etc.
- [ ] Join Paused Mob: When join mob where timer is paused, the timer shows 00:00 instead of the actual timer remaining.
      - [x] Fix and test in UI
      - [x] I've added a failing test to mobClientServer.test.ts that reproduces the bug, which fails even for the first client (doesn't
            require a 2nd client to join). Test is currently marked as skipped. I don't know why it still fails even though it succeeds in
            the UI; maybe I need to do a clean all and then try again so it's using the latest mobTimer class, which has the fix
- [x] Back Button: After adding people to a mob ("team1"), if you hit the back button in the browser and join a new mob ("team2"), you see 
      the people from the previous mob ("team1") in the UI for the new mob ("team2")
- [x] Fix bug: UI sound not playing
- [x] Bug when you create 2 new mobs in separate tabs of the same browser, starting the timer for one mob sometimes also starts it for the 
      other mob. This may depend on whether the back button has been used for one or more of the mobs. Having difficulty reproducing. It may be
      that having the controller be a singleton is causing this issue. (Similarly, with multiple mobs open in different tabs, sometime the
      EditPariticants and EditRoles input boxes don't work correctly, i.e., when you click on the input box, it remains blank rather than revealing
      the current comma-separated values and can't type in the box; and when you exit the input box, it asks if you want to replace the values with 
      an empty string.)

- Clean up UI:
- [x] Make time remaining text bigger
- [x] Spacing of buttons, e.g., show vertically stacked buttons horizontally instead (e.g., Start & Cancel on one line; Rotate & Randomize on one    
      line)                  

- Extract mobtimer-controller (refactor to share with both React mobtimer-frontend and mobtimer-vscode extension):
- [x] Decouple w3cwebsocket to allow choice of that or ws package (latter works in extension for mrozbarry) 
- [x] Get unit test working with WS Web Socket Wrapper (already works for W3C wrapper) (check console log - already set up in .on in test client)     
- [x] Split files by class (e.g., 3 files for 2 wrappers + 1 interface)

2023-05-06

- [x] Randomize participants order
- [x] Edit participants order
- [x] Add emojis to more UI buttons, and revise UI layout

2023-05-05

- [x] When frontend is available but backend is not, change play/pause button to say "Service Unavailable - Try Refreshing Your Browser in 1-3 minutes"
      (instead of "Start (temp hack)") 

2023-05-03

- [x] Display symbol in browser tab for whether timer is running or not, i.e., ▶️ if running and 🟥 if not (the latter being attention grabbing
      to help people notice the timer isn't running, which is commonly missed)

2023-04-30

- [x] Modify Participants UI and browser tab text (document title) with emojis for roles, etc.
  - Add participant names to browser tab text, so can see along with time remaining even when another tab is active. Entire mob is visible in tooltip (if hover),
    even if it's a long list.
  - Add emojis for Navigator and Driver

2023-04-05

- [x] Reset timer from UI (i.e,. Cancel)

2023-03-30

- [x] Delete unused files:
  - [x] home.html
  - [x] app.yaml
- [x] Get rid of unused css (from original react app)
- [x] Added error checking to tsconfig:
      "noUnusedParameters": true,
      "noImplicitReturns": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,

2023-03-29

- For deployment:
  - [x] Review duplicated code mobSocketClient (and dependency on websocket) and see "rethink mobtimer-api" in [Epics](./epics.md) for this
  - [x] Remove unused tasks and scripts, e.g., startAll2,...
  - [x] Deploy to render.com (fix error)
  - [x] Copy mobtimerclient to mobtimer-frontend and change references
  - [x] Set REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL to something like: wss://final1-u56m.onrender.com
  - [x] Verify working

2023-03-22

- [x] Create clean-all (reyarns all,...)

2023-02-01

- [x] Rotate participants on demand (button)
- [x] Make the UI timer tick-down less choppy, which often is especially obvious in the last second.
      (One-second delay in Timer.tsx can make browser clients off by 0.000 to 0.999 seconds from each other; interval is currently 1000 ms - maybe shorten - at least at first)

2023-01-31

- [x] Update document.title to show time remaining and Mob Timer (e.g., "01:28 - Mob Timer"). (Note: This shows up in the browser tab.)

2023-01-30

- [x] Play pneumatic horn sound when time expires, using wav file from: https://bigsoundbank.com/detail-1828-pneumatic-horn-simple-2.html
- [x] Add hardcoded roles to UI

2023-01-29

- [x] Add test for randomizing order of 3 participants (already had test for 2)

2023-01-28

- [x] Bug: After update duration minutes, UI timer sometimes keeps going into negative numbers even after time has expired.

2023-01-27

- [x] Refactor: Move mobTimer.tests.ts to mobtimer-api/test, and add config for debugging tests
- [x] Refactor: Fix word-wrapping in tests for ease of reading
- [x] Refactor: Change mockCurrentTime.ts to mobTestTimer and derive from mobTimer, allowing us to combine these 2 lines into one:
      From:
      const mobTimer = new MobTimer();
      const mockCurrentTime = createMockCurrentTime(mobTimer);
      To:
      const mockMobTimer = new MockMobTimer();

2023-01-26

- [x] Revisit tolerance seconds in \*.test.ts files (often 0.1) - but maybe not needed or could be much smaller, e.g., 0.01?
- [x] Revisit 0.1 in 3 places (2x in mobTimer.ts & once in mockCurrentTime.ts) - maybe can use booleans in some way (\_expired || !\_everStarted --> didn't work...)
- [x] Clarify nowInSecondsFunc with either comments or renaming in mockCurrentTime.ts
- [x] Add back test:
      In mobTimer.test.ts, add back the following test (immediately after the test "Get seconds remaining 1 second after start"):
      `     test("Get time remaining string 1 second after start", () => {
  const mobTimer = new MobTimer();
  const mockCurrentTime = createMockCurrentTime(mobTimer);
  mobTimer.durationMinutes = 6;
  mobTimer.start();
  mockCurrentTime.delaySeconds(1);
  expect(mobTimer.secondsRemainingString).toEqual("05:59");
});`
- [x] mobClientServer.test.ts changes:
  - [x] Revert mobClientServer.test.ts to version in main branch (prior to expire-timer branch)
  - [x] Remove tests that were later marked skipped

2023-01-25

- [x] Fixed bugs:
  - [x] When paused and start 2nd browser tab, latter tab says "00:00" instead of actual time remaining
  - [x] In 2nd browser tab, Turn Duration (minutes) doesn't show the correct minutes when updated elsewhere.
        We need to add durationMinutes and setDurationMinutes state variables to the Room.tsx form parameters.
  - [x] If pause/start timer rapidly when 1 sec. or less remaining, expire messages pile up.

2023-01-18

- [x] Add duration minutes textbox in UI and sync across clients
  - [x] Add texbox, label, and update button
  - [x] Update mobtimer on front and back ends when durationMinutes changes in UI
  - [x] Merge branch DurationMinutesUI back to main
- [x] Modify ActionButton when time elapses (should say Start again)
  - [x] Also: Investigate possible bug: When running timer from UI and time expires, the client gets a lot of messages in rapid succession, and
        then if the timer is restarted, the time remaining is the amount from the last time the timer was paused instead of the full amount
        of time (from duration minutes)
- [x] Move onMessage from mobSocketClient to be independently added

2023-01-12

- [x] Put action button on separate page that is shown after you join mob. See [React Router Proposal](./proposal-react-router.md)
- [x] Be able to access a mob via the URL (instead of the text box)
- [x] Fix bug(s) in accessing a mob via the URL (instead of the text box)
  - [x] See todo comments in Room.tsx
  - [x] Add useEffect to Room.tsx
  - [x] Guard for setMob function if mob is empty
  - [x] Add " as { mobName: string } " after useParams()
  - [x] Create variable mobNameLower - otherwise, doesn't work!
- [x] Refactor: Remove mobName/setMobName/submitJoinRequest from JoinMobForm.tsx (no longer needed)
- [x] Fix this: Every time the mob is joined from the UI, it joins twice. Also the Action button always triggers a join.
- [x] Display time remaining in UI - See [Display Time Remaining Proposal](./proposal-display-time.md)

2022-12-15

- [x] Refactor. Extend MobSocketTestClient from MobSocketClient, remove boolean for tracking, move onMessage and related code (lastResponse etc) from MobSocketClient to MobSocketTestClient

2022-12-15 (completed before this date)

- UI features in React:

  - [x] Start
  - [x] Read up on useState in React - e.g., why don't we need setLabel in ActionButton.tsx?
  - [x] Pause & Resume
  - [x] Review after hours changes, e.g., added mobTimer.toggle() functionality (in all layers)
  - [x] Hyperapp - try in CodePen (see bottom of our Google doc for what we did: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzzswKnbKsBagzEYMWYW2beelGWjuQzlxRzXQ8OcZhU/edit#)
  - [x] Continue with Hyperapp tutorial (implementing in mobtimer-frontend-hyperapp)
  - [x] Aborted: Implement Hyperapp front end basic features: - [x] Open socket (import mob client, etc.) - [x] Configure - [x] Remove hello.ts
  - [x] Remove Hyperapp
  - [x] WARNING: If keeping React Frontend, need to add back "frontend start" as a dependency in startAll !!!!
  - [x] Implement trackMessages boolean in mob socket client (so that the client can turn on/off storing messages from the server).
  - [x] Make scripts more stable (by using copy vs. link - and/or order of things; currently startAll works the 2nd time after a change to a ts file in mobtimer-api when using cp - might be same with link - Ethan to look into this)
  - [x] Display state: ready, running, paused
  - [x] UI features (without styling) for all server-exposed methods - using Hyperapp

- [x] Decide on HyperApp, ferp, mrbarry vs. React [Pros and Cons](./pros-and-cons.md)
- [x] Migrate Agenda and Reminders on Google Docs to md file
- [x] Discuss/fix Ethan's keyboard

- [x] Strong Types: ALSO ADD STRONG TYPES FOR ERROR RESPONSE AND ECHO RESPONSE (use sendJSON function, etc.) IN MOB SOCKET SERVER (SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN OUR WAIT FOR ECHO RESPONSE FUNCTION - EVERYWHERE WITH JSON.PARSE USE EXPLICIT TYPE)

  - [x] ErrorResponse
  - [x] EchoResponse (Note: Joel finished this after time ran out at 5:30 on Thurs. 11/10/22)
  - [x] SuccessfulResponse (contains mobState and is used for mob)
  - [x] Review after-hours changes (EchoResponse & SuccessfulResponse) with Ethan if he wants to
  - [x] Joel: remove errorResponses from successfulResponses (or if it makes sense, something else)
  - [x] Review after-hours changes: Joel removed errorResponses from successfulResponses and created errorReceived boolean (similar to echoReceived boolean)

- [x] Join mob
- [x] Discuss HyperApp, ferp, mrbarry VS React

2022-11-10

- [x] Request/response ids aren't working - maybe a problem with function getUuid(): string { return uuidv4(); };

Refactoring

- [x] move testUtils.ts, mobClientSocket.ts back to mobtimer-api
- [x] mobclientserver.test.ts: use 'echo' action - see [proposal-echo.md](./proposal-echo.md)
  - [x] Combine two echo lines from test into one
  - [x] Remove id from tests
  - [x] Remove id from model
  - [x] Fix two tests marked as skip
- [x] merge back onto main branch (from move-files-to-api)
- [x] Get rid of functions for each request that have json.stringify, and make a helper function that does json.stringify + socket.send together
- [x] Consider more ways to reduce number of places have to make a change when add a new request/response type. Consider proxy generation.
      (We currently have a lot of code to insure strong typing, but proxy generation could remove one or two steps, possibly.) If making
      a change, try adding a new feature, e.g., Add Cancel (timer) function - [x] In index.ts - [x] In mobTimerRequests - [x] Other (if applicable, e.g., mobSocketClient)
- [x] mobclientserver.test.ts: use 'echo' action - see [proposal-echo.md](./proposal-echo.md)
- [x] Combine two echo lines from test into one
- [x] Remove id from tests
  - [x] Remove id from model
  - [x] Fix two tests marked as skip
- [x] merge back onto main branch (from move-files-to-api)

      (We currently have a lot of code to insure strong typing, but proxy generation could remove one or two steps, possibly.) If making
      a change, try adding a new feature, e.g., Add Cancel (timer) function - [x] In index.ts - [x] In mobTimerRequests - [x] Other (if applicable, e.g., mobSocketClient)

Technical

- [x] Prevent mobtimer-api package from including src

Functional

- [x] UI - Create a form for starting a mob. Result: acknowledge button is pressed and value of field)
- [x] See [proposal for web socket client](./proposal-websocketclient.md)
      [x] Google zlib errors with react
      [x] Or use a different web socket library that works well with react
      [x] Test can connect to mob
