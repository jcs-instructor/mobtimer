- Change controller to be a multiton (vs singleton)
- After _client1 has been set:
  - Set controller1 = new Controller()
  - Set controller1.client = _client1
  - For each set<something> function that needs to be defined, 
   - in before all, set<something> = jest.fn()
   - create a test that 
     - updates <something>
     - assert set<something> function is called once
     - assert that set<something> is called with the expected value(s)
